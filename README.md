# A-Kim-Cloud-Resume-Challenge
The Cloud Resume Challenge is designed as a way for new learners of networks and cloud computing systems to gain valuable hands-on practice and project experience. Taking on this challenge initially was a challenge, but served to teach a variety of valuable skills including usage of cloud serves and serverless databases (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Route53, CloudFront, and S3), full-stack software development (HTML, Python, static website creation and hosting), and networking (DNS, cloud software, SSH commands) amongst many other skills. 

This GitHub serves as part of the automation and source controlling aspect of my Cloud Resume Challenge attempt, but also serves as a retrospective on the whole process. For navigation purposes, it is broken up into three parts, the frontend (website), the backend API (visitor counter), and integration/automation (Terraforming, source controlling, and testing). They can be found here:
